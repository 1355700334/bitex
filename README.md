# BitEx
BitEx is a collection of API Clients for Crypto Currency Exchanges.

It provides API classes for various REST-based APIs for a variety of 
crypto exchanges. It handles authentication as well as granting access to 
all endpoints via the low level api interface.


# State
--------------------------------

**API** : **Completed**

**Clients** : **WIP**

--------------------------------
As of now, only REST APIs are supported, implementations of websockets 
and FIX connections are being considered.

The following exchanges are supported

REST-based APIs:
- GDAX (implemented)
- Bitfinex (implemented)
- Bitstamp (implemented)
- Kraken (implemented)
- Coincheck (public endpoint communication done)
- OKCoin (public endpoint communication done)
- BTC-E (public endpoint communication done) [DEPRECATED] - Too shitty 
                                            support, pardon my french.
- Bittrex (public endpoint communication done)
- C-CEX (public endpoint communication done)
- Cryptoptia (public endpoint communication done)
- Yunbi (public endpoint communication done)
- Gemini (public endpoint communication done)
- TheRockTradingLTD (public endpoint communication done)


-`planned`: I'm currently designing base code for this exchange

-`public endpoint communication done`: You're able to communicate with 
the API using its respective API class with `public` endpoints only.

-`implemented`: Authentication protocols have been implemented and the 
class' `query()` method supports the `authenticate=True` flag



Additional clients will be added to (or removed from) this list, 
according to their liquidity and market volume.

In their basic form, clients provide a simple connection to APIs - that 
is, they handle authentication and request construction for you. As soon 
the above list is completed to a point where most of the exchanges are 
implemented (or whenever I feel like it), I will add convenience layers 
to the clients; this layer will aim to make calling the api feel more 
like a function, instead of string construction 
(i.e. `kraken.ticker('XBTEUR')`, instead of typing 
`kraken.public_query({'pair': 'XBTEUR'})`). 

# REST APIs

The above listed exchanges all have an implemented API class in 
`bitex.api`. These provide low-level access to the
respective exchange's REST API, including handling of authentication. 
They do not feature convenience methods, so you will
have to write some things yourself. 

At their core, they can be thought of as simple overlay methods for 
`requests.request()` methods, as all
kwargs passed to query, are also passed to these methods as well. They 
simply handle the exchange's authentication protocols as well.

An example:
```
from bitex.api.rest import KrakenREST

k = KrakenREST()
k.load_key('kraken.key')  # loads key and secret from given file;

<<<<<<< HEAD
k.query('public/Depth', params={'pair': 'XXBTZUSD'})
k.query('GET', 'private/AddOrder', authenticate=True,
            params={'pair': 'XXBTZUSD', 'type': 'sell', 'ordertype': 'limit',
                    'price': 1000.0, 'volume': 0.01, 'validate': True})
=======
k.query('GET','public/Depth', params={'pair': 'XXBTZUSD'})
k.query('POST','private/AddOrder', authenticate=True,
        params={'pair': 'XXBTZUSD', 'type': 'sell', 'ordertype': 'limit',
                'price': 1000.0, 'volume': 0.01, 'validate': True})
>>>>>>> dev
```

Example `.key` file:
```
>>>dummy.key
my_api_key
my_fancy_api_secret
```

If the api requires further details, for example a userid or account 
number (for example for bitstamp), this needs to go before the api key 
and secret, on a separate line each.
```
>>>dummy2.key
Userid
accountname
my_api_key
my_fancy_api_secret
```
