functions for exchange interfaces.

### Changed
General:

API Clients
- The base class `RESTAPI` has been renamed to `APIClient` to better reflect
its purpose
- The class `APIClient` is now an ABC
- The attribute `request_methods` has been removed and its logic and purpose
replaced by using `requests.request()` instead.

subclass of `requests.Response` and adds an attribute `formatted` - which
contains formatted json data, if available.
- Bitstamp's `tickers` method had its surplus `s` removed.

### Deprecated
